Current features:
-----------------

 * Fixtures.
 * Scores.

To Do
-----

 * Proper backend API for Live Scores
 * Redesign the layout
 * Offline support.

Notes:
-----

 * Coding and data entry in 3 hrs. The CODE IS REALLY DIRTY.
 * Used plain JSON files for showing fixtures and updating goal scores. Special thanks to [Ye Lin Aung](https://github.com/yelinaung) for [JSONForUCL](https://github.com/sHa92/JsonForUCL) codes.
 * If someone interested in writing backend API, please contact me.
 * Feel free to fork and send me pull requests.

Special Thanks
--------------

 * Kyaw Khine for really great Data Entry
 * Ye Lin Aung for JSON files solutions.
 * Tin Aung Lin for server setup.
